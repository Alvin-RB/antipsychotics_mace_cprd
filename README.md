This study aimed to emulate a trial on the following research question: In adults diagnosed with SMI who are prescribed a new antipsychotic in primary care, what is the effect of aripiprazole, as compared to olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone, on the long-term risk of major adverse cardiovascular events? The data source is [Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)](https://www.cprd.com/).
